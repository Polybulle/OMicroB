synopsis: "An OCaml generic
virtual machine for microcontrollers"
description: """
OMicroB is an OCaml virtual machine dedicated at running OCaml programs on
devices with very limited resources such as AVR Atmega32u4 microcontrollers (2.5
ko of RAM).
This tools, steming from the works of OCaPIC (https://github.com/bvaugon/ocapic)
consists of a generic virtual machine, which can be ported on various
architectures.
OMicroB performs multiple static analysis passes in order to reduce the
generated final executable.
